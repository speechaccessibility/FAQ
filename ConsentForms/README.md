# Consent Forms

This directory is intended to document the terms to which any
participant in the Speech Accessibility Project has given consent.
When a new consent form is deployed to participants using the
participant software, it is also posted here, so that any interested
person (including any participant or potential participant in the
Speech Accessibility Project) can read it at will.

Different etiologies may require different types of consent or verbal
assent.  At a minimum, language specifying inclusion criteria will
change, depending on the etiology of one's speech impairment.  For
some of the etiologies, more significant modifications may be
necessary, but we retain fundamental terms describing the conditions
under which data may be distributed.

These consent forms are covered by the same MIT License as the rest of
the corpus, so feel free to re-use any lines or paragraphs that might
be useful to your study.  If you have recommendations or questions,
please tell us, either by e-mail to
speechaccessibility@beckman.illinois.edu, or by raising an issue on
this github repository.
